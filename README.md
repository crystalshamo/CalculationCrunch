This is an online learning program, which helps beginner math students pratice simple arithmetic skills. It helps students practice basic concepts. Students are able to choose between multiplication, divison, addition, and subtraction. Each option takes the user to a space themed game in which the goal is to get the rocket to the moon by answering 10 questions correctly. The rocket moves upwards as questions are answered correctly.

How to run this application, Java 17 and JavaFX 19 resources are required. To run the .jar file while you are in the same directory, the user must type the following into their terminal:

java --module-path (your_file_path)/javafx-sdk-19/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.base,javafx.graphics,javafx.media,javafx.swing -jar CalculationCrunch.jar

Once the application is running, click on the menubar and find the option you are looking for. Press on which operation you would like to practice and once you are inside the game, you will be given randomized questions. Type in your answer in the text field and press submit to check whether it is right or wrong. Once your answer is checked, hit the "continue" button to continue practicing. If you want to return to the main menu, click the "home" button. We hope you enjoy the game and use it to better your mathematical abilities! For more details about how to use this application or information about what our project does, please refer to the User Manual and Implementation Manual provided.
